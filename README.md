Array JAVA Exercises

Exercise 1: Array Sum</br>
Write a Java program that calculates the sum of all elements in an array of integers.

Exercise 2: Array Average</br>
Write a Java program that calculates the average of elements in an array of integers.

Exercise 3: Array Maximum and Minimum</br>
Write a Java program that finds both the maximum and minimum values in an array of integers.

Exercise 4: Array Search</br>
Write a Java program that searches for a specific element in an array of integers and returns its index. If the element is not found, indicate that it's not in the array.

Exercise 5: Array Copy</br>
Write a Java program that copies the contents of one array into another array of the same size.

Exercise 6: Array Reverse</br>
Write a Java program that reverses the order of elements in an array.

Exercise 7: Array Sorting</br>
Write a Java program that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using a sorting algorithm (e.g., Bubble Sort).

Exercise 8: Array Intersection</br>
Write a Java program that finds the intersection of two arrays (common elements) and stores them in a new array.

Exercise 9: Array Rotation</br>
Write a Java program that rotates the elements of an array to the right by a specified number of positions.

Exercise 10: Array Frequency Count</br>
Write a Java program that counts the frequency of each element in an array and displays the results.

Exercise 11: Unique Elements</br>
Write a Java program that finds and prints the unique (non-repeated) elements in an array.

Exercise 12: Array Intersection Count</br>
Write a Java program that finds the number of elements that are common in two arrays (intersection count) without duplicating the count for repeated elements.

Exercise 13: Merge Arrays</br>
Write a Java program that merges two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.

Exercise 14: Array Subtraction</br>
Write a Java program that finds and prints the elements in one array that are not present in another array.

Exercise 15: Prime Numbers in an Array</br>
Write a Java program that identifies and prints all the prime numbers in an array of integers.

Exercise 16: Array Palindrome</br>
Write a Java program that checks if an array of integers is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards).

Exercise 17: Array Shift</br>
Write a Java program that shifts the elements of an array to the left by a specified number of positions.

Exercise 18: 2D Array Operations</br>
Create a 2D array and perform operations such as finding the sum of elements in each row and column, finding the maximum value, and printing the array.

Exercise 19: Matrix Multiplication</br>
Write a Java program that performs matrix multiplication for two 2D arrays.

Exercise 20: Array Sorting with Custom Comparator
Write a Java program that sorts an array of custom objects (e.g., objects with a name and age) using a custom comparator.
